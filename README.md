Changes made:
On index.html I added the viewport to make responsive work on mobile.

Removed Header Nav Menu

and moved to external file for later use.

But in a detection class to show different image on mobile for header to account for shrinking size.

Added a crop of the header.png for mobile only.

Added a quick-fix temporary embeded style that should be integrated with other stylesheets.
